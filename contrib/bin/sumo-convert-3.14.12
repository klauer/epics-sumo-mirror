finished!

A file 'MODULES' containing the module dependencies was created in
directory 'configure'. You may review or modify that file.

In order to build your application you first have to run 

    sumo build use

in order to create the file 'configure/RELEASE' from
'configure/MODULES'.

If 'sumo build use' says that no build matches the modulespecs run 

    sumo build new
    
If 'sumo build new' says that your module specifications are
incomplete, run

    sumo build try
    
and add missing dependency modules in configure/MODULES.
